				<p>Hi there! I'm Michael, a second year computer science student at RIT. Alongside seeking a Bachelor of Science,
					I am studying Web Development and Business Management as minors. My plate is pretty full here, but I wouldn't be
					doing so much if I wasn't so passionate about it!</p>
					
				<p>When I'm not working on a program or meeting with a project team, I can often be found rock climbing at the Red Barn,
					playing tennis, looking up (and making up) new recipes, or catching up on whatever is new in comedy. </p>
				
				<p>I was drawn to computer science back in high school when I took an introductory programming course in C++. Right away,
					the method of thinking and problem solving clicked with me and I knew what I wanted to do when I grew up! I am eager
					to learn all I can in the world of computing, and gain experience in software design, development, and testing. I am 
					currently seeking co-op and internship positions for summer 2017. Hopefully we'll be working together in the future!</p>
				
				<p id="signoff">Until then,<br/>Michael</p>
