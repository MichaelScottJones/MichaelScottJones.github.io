		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<main class="body_text">
			
			<p>Outside of school, I like to stay busy with physical activity, clubs, personal projects,
				and social events. My favorite sport by far is climbing, and I love going out and climbing
				in nature! In addition to climbing, I've been golfing my whole life and I've recently
				started playing tennis. Staying active is very important to me, and it allows me to destress
				after a hard day's work.</p>
			<p>As far as personal projects, I often have a couple of things that I'm working on in my free time.
				At the moment, I have been occupying myself with building a personal website to host my resume,
				contact info, and personal overview. It's been a lot of fun to learn HTML and CSS through 
				research, trial, and error! My other recent, much bigger personal endeavor was a project I
				undertook with a couple of friends. Together, we built an Android app that used real-time 
				data to tell a user the best parking spot available based on the lot's population and the 
				spot's proximity to the user's desired building. Without any prior exposure to Android Studio
				or OpenCV, the three of us built the app and used it successfully with a model lot and 
				webcam. It was a lot of fun, and we plan on continuing development in the future!</p>
