				<h3>EPA</h3>
				<p>Developed on a team of three first-time hackers, this Android app processes photos
					in real time to show a user the best available parking spot. Building the app took
					all 24 hours to complete, and received the Best Newbie Hack award.</p>
				<p>Recently, the team got back together to pick up where we left off. Look out for updates
					in the near future!</p>

				<h3>Healthnet</h3>
				<p>With a team of five people, I built a healthcare-based web app using Django. The app
					was meant for use by patients and hospital staff to keep track of medical records,
					user data, appointment calendar, and hospital admittance.</p>
				<p>In the end, we completed the app on time with a few extra features, and received an
					A!</p><br/>

				<h3>Wow App</h3>
				<p style="text-align: center">Hey you!</p>
				<p>Do you want an app that will play Owen Wilson's trademark "Wow" every time you click his face?
					What if it randomly plays one of thirty unique "Wow"s? No? To both? Oh.</p>

				<h3>Personal Site</h3>
				<p style="text-align: center">You're already here!</p>
				<p>Everything you see here has been written by hand and hosted (for now) on GitHub.
					This site is a work in progress, so come back every now and then to see how it
					improves!</p>
